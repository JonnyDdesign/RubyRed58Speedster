## Ruby Red 58 Speedster

# About the Project
Check out this website I created to showcase the restoration of this ravishing ruby red 1958 Porsche 356A Speedster.  
My dad purchased this vehicle approximately 50 years ago, drove it around a bit and then stashed it away in a garage for about the next 40 years.  
The restoration of this car began in early-2014 and recently completed a full concours level restoration in mid-2024. I decided to create a website to share
the journey of the restoration and share pictures and describe the process this car has been through to bring it back to life as it left the German factory back in 1958.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with additional technologies that I may incporporate later as I learn more in my programming journey.

## Setup/Installation
Clone this repo and open up the index.html file to view the website on your browser.

## Status
