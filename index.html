    <h2>Where it Started</h2>
    <img src="images/started1.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting in garage after 50 years in storage">
    <p>Wayyyy back in 1974, this Porsche 356A Speedster was locked up in a garage and never saw the light of day until 2011, when that garage door opened to reveal this beautiful specimen. Well, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as this car once saw better days.</p>
    <img src="images/started2.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting in garage after 50 years in storage">
    <p>However, this was the start of a journey that would last nearly a decade to restore this beautiful car back to its glory days when she rolled of the assembly line in Stuttgart, Germany back in 1958.</p>

    <h2>First Tow and Delivery</h2>
    <img class="reveal" src="images/Tow1.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting on a trailer">
    <p>The journey began in March 2014 with a trip up to Tempe, AZ on a trailer, and again, she has seen better days. What she didn't know was that her body and and all her supporting parts were about to be restored back to all factory settings.</p>
    <img class="reveal" src="images/Tow2.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting on a trailer">
    <p>After a safe trailer ride up to the valley of the sun, the car was delivered to Deluxe Customs. Matt Howard is the proud owner of Deluxe Customs and he prides himself in doing outstanding restorations with plenty of examples of work to backup his skills as a craftsman.</p>

    <h2>Gettin' Blasted</h2>
    <p>Next step in the process, media blasting. The body was media blasted to strip away all paint and other crud to reveal the true condition of the body...which in this case, was looking a bit rough.</p>
