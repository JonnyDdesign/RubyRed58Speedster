    <h2>Where it Started</h2>
    <img src="images/started1.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting in garage after 50 years in storage">
    <p>Wayyyy back in 1974, this Porsche 356A Speedster was locked up in a garage and never saw the light of day until 2011, when that garage door opened to reveal this beautiful specimen. Well, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as this car once saw better days.</p>
    <img src="images/started2.webp" alt="Porsche Speedster sitting in garage after 50 years in storage">
    <p>However, this was the start of a journey that would last nearly a decade to restore this beautiful car back to its glory days when she rolled of the assembly line in Stuttgart, Germaany back in 1958.</p>

    <p>The journey began in March 2014 with a trip up to Tempe, AZ on a trailer, and again, she has seen better days. What she didn't know was that her body and and all her supporting parts were about to be restored back to all factory settings.</p>
